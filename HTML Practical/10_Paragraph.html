        <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
        HTML provides a means to creat structured documents by dentoing stuctural semantics for text such
        as<b><i>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</i></b><br>HTML elements are delineated by
        tags, written using <u>angle brackets</u>.Tags such as &ltimg/&gt and &ltinput/&gt directly introduce content
        into the page <br> Other tags such as &ltp&gt surrounf and provide information about document text and many
        include other tags as sub-element.<br> Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the
        content of the page.
